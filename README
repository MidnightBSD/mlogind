INTRODUCTION
    mlogind is a graphical login manager for X11.
    It aims to be simple, fast and independent from the various
    desktop environments.
    mlogind is based on latest stable release of Login.app by Per Liden
    and SLiM 1.3.6.

    New features:
    - External themes and configuration
    - PNG support with alpha transparency for panel
    - PNG / JPEG support for backgrounds
    - XFT / freetype support
    - Double or single (GDM-style) inputbox support
    - CMake build procedure

INSTALLATION
    see the INSTALL file
    
USAGE

    To launch mlogind, execute run the mlogind binary,
    followed by the -d option if you want it to
    run as a daemon in the background (reccommended)
    
    enter username and password to login. The ~/.xinitrc
    file is executed by default, so be sure to have a working
    .xinitrc file in your home.
    
    Special usernames (commands configurable in the config file):
    - console: start console login
    - exit: exit SLiM
    - halt: halt the system
    - reboot: reboot the system
    
    pressing the F11 key executes a user-specified
    command (see the configuration file), the default
    is to take a screenshot if the 'import' program is available.
    
CONFIGURATION
    /usr/local/etc/mlogind.conf is the main configuration file.
    Options are explained in the file itself
